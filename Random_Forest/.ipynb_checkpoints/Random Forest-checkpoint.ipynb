    "1.\tIn this project, I build a Random Forest Classifier to predict the safety of the car. I build two models, one with 10 decision-trees and another one with 100 decision-trees. \n",
    "2.\tThe model accuracy score with 10 decision-trees is 0.9247 but the same with 100 decision-trees is 0.9457. So, as expected accuracy increases with number of decision-trees in the model.\n",
    "3.\tI have used the Random Forest model to find only the important features, build the model using these features and see its effect on accuracy. The most important feature is `safety` and least important feature is `doors`.\n",
    "4.\tI have removed the `doors` variable from the model, rebuild it and checked its accuracy. The accuracy of the model with `doors` variable removed is 0.9264. The accuracy of the model with all the variables taken into account is 0.9247. So, we can see that the model accuracy has been improved with `doors` variable removed from the model.\n",
    "5.\tThe second least important model is `lug_boot`. If I remove it from the model and rebuild the model, then the accuracy was found to be 0.8546. It is a significant drop in the accuracy. So, I will not drop it from the model.\n",
    "6.\tConfusion matrix and classification report are another tool to visualize the model performance. They yield good performance.\n",
